# Introduction

This challenge has the same content of folder `5_docker_compose`, but now we will list the users on frontend.

# Solution

I Copied the content of `5_docker_compose` subfolder `node`, and modify the index.js file to list the users.

The only thing i changed, is to invoce peopleModel and create a Model to list the users.

# How to run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Open the browser on `http://localhost:8080` and you will see the users list.
